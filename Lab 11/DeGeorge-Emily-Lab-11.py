# Build on your code using mine as reference (or if you find something else, cite it). Things to add to make it fully operational:
# 
# (1) Integrate a clickable button that will make a new question appear
# 
# (2) Figure out a system of keeping track of points. 
# 
# (3) Display how many questions the player got right after all the questions have been gone through 
# 
# Will be graded on completion. Do as best as you can & get as many elements as possible. If you canâ€™t get parts to work, explain in a comment why & what you tried. If you look up other code, CITE IT!

# trivia game that utilizes radio buttons, has pt system and final score listed
# my next step would be fixing the print out of the questions themselves; fixing the typos when quotes are involved etc.
